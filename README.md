# Wallpapers Collection

This repos contain many various wallpapers for your PC. They are all 1920x1080 or above and in 16:9. 
They're mainly nature, abstract, drawings and buildings related, they are some animes wallpapers too but I put them in another folder because they are not for normies.

These wallpapers come from various websites : 
- <a href="https://unsplash.com/" >Unsplash</a>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" >Reddit</a>
- <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/" >DeviantArt</a>


And I also made a colors folder that contains some 1920x1080 wallpapers with one color each. Made by myself in FIGMA
